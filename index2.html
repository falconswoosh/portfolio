  <h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born in Los Angeles, lived in the Philippines a few years, and grew up in Hawaii. I had a tour in the Amry National Guard while attending college. My interest in computers levitated me towards a career in supporting them while working in local government as well as a side business I owned selling, configuring, and repairing them. My last job was at Intel and worked there for 21 years in various roles. In my last role I was a procurement and project manager for worldwide IT projects. I am married and have two boys. I also have a young girl who is now in middle school. We have a new addition to our family... she's a border terrier.</p>

  <h2 class="col-md-12">Why I am enrolled in Epicodus' programming course</h2>
  <p, class="col-md-12">I am changing careers from managing projects and people. I had always dabbled in coding in my various jobs and roles producing either role-related or intra-company tools for IT teams. I felt it was a good time to gain the most current and relevant skills needed to become a full-fledged programmer.
