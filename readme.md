## Description

This website is our first project for the Introduction to Programming. It contains information about myself and why I enrolled in this course.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* index.html in the main project folder

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

The table at the very bottom was meant to have the column titles on top; yet I had to modify the implementation slightly due to time and instead have them as row titles.
